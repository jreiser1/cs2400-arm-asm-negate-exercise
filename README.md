# ARM Assembly Negate Exercise

MSUD, CS 2400, Spring 2019

## Requirements

### Preliminaries
1. Download and install [VisUAL](https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/downloads.html).
2. Find out what UAL means in the context of ARM syntax.
3. Review the instructions supported by VisUAL.

### Quick negate
1. Load the [short negate program](https://github.com/ivogeorg/cs2400-arm-asm-negate-exercise/blob/master/negate.S) into VisUAL (Use **Open** from the menu).
2. Execute the program. View the memory. (Use **Tools** from the menu.)
3. **QUESTION:** What does the program do?
4. Single-step the program and watch the registers, memory locations, and status flags change.

### Long negate
1. Load the [long negate program](https://github.com/ivogeorg/cs2400-arm-asm-negate-exercise/blob/master/negate_gcc_8_2.S) into VisUAL (Use **Open** from the menu).
2. Execute the program. View the memory. (Use **Tools** from the menu.)
3. Answer the following questions:
   1. **QUESTION 1:** What is the short program doing that the long program is not?
   
   The short program loops through the words array in a more efficient manner, while the long program stores most or all of the array seperately in registers
   
   2. **QUESTION 2:** Why do you think the compiler has generated such assembly code?
   
   Because the instructions overall are simpler, even if the entire set of instructions is longer. This is so that the computer can be more efficient.
   
   3. **QUESTION 3:** How would you try to change the code so that the compiler would generate an assembly program that behaves more like the short one above? The original code is in [`negate.c`](https://github.com/ivogeorg/cs2400-arm-asm-negate-exercise/blob/master/negate.c). Modify it and see if that changes the generated code. (The code is generated in the [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org). Use the **ARM gcc 8.2** compiler. Use the following compiler options: `-fomit-frame-pointer -mcpu=cortex-m3 -mtune=cortex-m3`. *Note: The assembly generated by the Compiler Explorer cannot be run directly in VisUAL. You might want to check the differences between the original generated code and the long negate program to see what modifications you have make.*)
   
   I would add a loop to iterate through the array and negate each value instead of taking the entire array into memory simultaneously.

4. Single-step the program and watch the registers, memory locations, and status flags change.
5. Modify the long program to do what the short one is doing.

### Submission
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone and develop.
3. Commit your changes and push to the remote.
4. Submit your fork's URL on the Google Classroom assignment **CS 2400 - Classwork - ARM assembly negate exercise**.
